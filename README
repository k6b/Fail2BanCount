INSTALL:

<<INSTALLER TO BE MADE>>

cp ./bancountmysql /usr/local/bin/
cp ./bancount /usr/local/bin/
mysql -e "CREATE DATABASE fail2bancount;"
mysql -e "GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON `fail2bancount`.* TO \
    'fail2bancount'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY PASSWORD '<YOUR PASSWORD HERE>';"
mysql fail2bancount < fail2bancount.sql

Fail2Ban Hax:

Edit the following in /etc/fail2ban/action.d/iptables*.conf, you'll need to do 
this for each one of the ban "actions" you're using:

actionban = iptables -I fail2ban-<name> 1 -s <ip> -j DROP
            /usr/local/bin/bancountmysql ban <ip>


actionunban = iptables -D fail2ban-<name> -s <ip> -j DROP
              /usr/local/bin/bancountmysql unban <ip>

There should be something similar if you are using something other than 
iptables. But don't ask me, learn how to use iptables.

Web Page:

First, edit the top of bancount.php and put the password you chose for your 
MySQL user, don't forget to edit the other settings if you chose something 
different. Then place bancount.css and bancount.php in a directory that's 
accessable to your web server. That should be it.

Please let me know if you run into any issues, if I've forgotten anything, if 
I've made any mistakes, or if you think I can do something better. If you hate 
it, let me know, I'll change it! It's likely I've overlooked things because it 
works well on my setup and it not quite ment for public consumption yet.


Thanks!
